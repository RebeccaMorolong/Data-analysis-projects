# Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to the Data Analysis Projects repository! This repository contains various data analysis projects implemented using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


### Project Structure

Each project directory has the following structure:
- **Project Overview**"
- **KeyFeatues**: Brief description of the project.
- **Notebooks and Project Insights**: This directory contains the Jupyter Notebooks with the analysis and code.
- **Dataset Information**: This file provides information about the specific project.

## Projects
## Project 1

## üìå Project Overview  
 This analysis was inspired by real-world factors influencing insurance premiums.In this project we uncover if there's a Corelation between Insurance Premiums and variables such as Driver Age , Driver Experience , Car Age ,etc. We further investigate the average insurance premium across different age groups to determine if younger or older drivers pay significantly more or less.

 **Insight : There is a Positive correlation between Driver Age and Insurance Premium**
![newplot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3ff3a60-dfbe-47f1-b546-9470ecd5c783)

**Younger drivers tend to pay high insurance premium than older driver.**

# Regression model insights
![Screenshot (75)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03bbe8f3-2c67-419d-be4a-97f0994be582)
**For every additional year of driver age, the insurance premium decreases by approximately 0.33 units (assuming all else is equal).**
**The model suggests that both driver age and car age are significant predictors of insurance premiums. Older drivers tend to have lower premiums, while older cars tend to have higher premiums.**

## üìÅ Dataset Information  
### Source  
- **Primary Data**:[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/govindaramsriram/car-insurance-premium-dataset]
- This file contains 1,000 rows of simulated car insurance data. Each row represents a unique driver and their associated insurance premium, calculated based on several factors such as age, driving experience, accident history, and more. 

### Structure  
| Column Name | Data Type | Description |  
|-------------|-----------|-------------|  
| `Driver Age`  | `float`   | Metric for X |  
| `Insurance Premium`    | `int`     | Outcome variable |

 **The graph demontrates that canceletions are most common when the prices are high with the Average being 101 and the least common when they are low. Therefore , the
  cost of accomodation is sorely responsible for the cancellations.**

![output2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cf43ad3-db26-4c80-9fa2-4e23bdd0dea2)

   **37% of the clients cancelled their reservations , which had a significant impact on the hotel
  earnings.**

  ![output6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9d93f4a-06f2-46ce-aaf4-10debda976d2)
   **Around 46% of clients come from online travel agents, whereas 16.6% come from Groups. Only 10.4% of clients book hotels directly by visiting and
making reservations**

![output5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cec95684-668b-4393-b887-38a6181b27a2)

  **The Top 10 country with the highest canceletion is Portugal.**
